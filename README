This example is based on Torizon IDE Extension "C++ Makefile Console" template.
It is adjusted to provide a simple GTK+3 development environment that you can use to get started developing user interface on the BeFREE03 module.
You can run and debug the example on the BeFREE03 module as well as locally on the windows machine (WSL2).
